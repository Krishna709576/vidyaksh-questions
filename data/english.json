    "explanation": "The number of letters increases by 1 each time, and one letter is skipped between groups. AB (skip C) DEF (skip G) HIJK (skip L) -> MNOPQ is wrong, wait. Logic: AB (2), DEF (3), HIJK (4). Next is 5 letters. Skip L. -> MNOPQ. (Correction: Let's look at the gap between last and first. B->D (+2), F->H (+2), K->M (+2). So M, N, O, P, Q. The option 'LMNOP' implies a different gap logic. Let's adjust for standard exams: often it's just count. AB, DEF, HIJK, STUVW. Let's use a simpler specific logic for the options provided: AB(2), DEF(3), HIJK(4), next is 5 letters starting after skipping one letter (L). So MNPQR? No, let's fix the question to be clearer. 'AB, DEF, HIJK, ?'. B->D is +2. F->H is +2. K->M (+2). So starts with M. Length is 5. MNOPQ. Let's provide 'LMNOP' as a distractor and 'MNOPQ' as answer. Actually, let's stick to the options in the array. Let's go with 'MNOPQ'.",
